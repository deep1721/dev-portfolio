A [website](https://livestreamradio.netlify.com/) that allows a user to add & categorize YouTube livestreams as “stations”. Open source and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/sparlos/livestream-radio).

Some highlights include from scratch design, animations and transitions all hand coded using SCSS & BEM methodology and a ‘mini-app’ that wraps the SoundCloud iFrame API and lets a user play songs with a completely custom design and interface. The entire site is powered using [Cockpit CMS](https://getcockpit.com/) for easy addition of new projects.

Time restrictions meant this site had to be built within a week. This restriction ended up being extremely beneficial for the project, forcing the most crucial features to the forefront.

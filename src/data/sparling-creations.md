A [website](https://livestreamradio.netlify.com/) that allows a user to add & categorize YouTube livestreams as “stations”. Open source and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/sparlos/livestream-radio).

Time restrictions meant this site had to be built within a week. This restriction ended up being extremely beneficial for the project, forcing the most crucial features to the forefront.

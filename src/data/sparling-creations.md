A [website](http://sparlingcreations.com/) built to house my freelance web design, video and audio projects. The site is powered by Vue and uses Vue Router for navigation.

The design is completely from-scratch in Adobe XD, with animations and transitions all hand coded using SCSS & BEM methodology. A definitely highlight is the mini-app I wrote in Vue that wraps the SoundCloud iFrame API in the ‘music’ section of the site. I did this for aesthetic and design reasons so that the music player would fit the overall feel of the design more. The entire site is powered using [Cockpit CMS](https://getcockpit.com/) for easy addition of new projects.

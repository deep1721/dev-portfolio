[A website](http://dev.sparlingcreations.com/) made to showcase the web development & design projects of Stephen Sparling. I attempted a very minimalist, clean looking website that focuses on ease of navigation for a user to find the info they want. The user experience is enhanced by sleek, purposeful animations to bring the userâ€™s attention to the fact that something has changed on the page.

The design was created entirely using Figma, and is powered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a great utility-first CSS framework. All animations are either hand-crafted in SCSS or utilize the excellent [Framer Motion library](https://www.framer.com/motion/). The functionality of the site comes from Gatsby, with some custom React code and graphQL queries.

Soruce code for the site [is avaliable here](https://github.com/sparlos/dev-portfolio).

A [collection of CodePen experiments](https://codepen.io/collection/Xermmq) that were created for CodePen’s weekly challenges. As I have a music background and not too many people use music/audio as a feature in web development, I further added to the challenge and made every challenge submission based around music.

The collection includes:

- [generative music based on prime numbers](https://codepen.io/sparlos/pen/oOqMGw)
- [an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm represented using tones](https://codepen.io/sparlos/pen/gydjdL)
- [an infinitely random starfield where every star creates a tone based on the star’s Y position](https://codepen.io/sparlos/pen/QRwVjp)
- [a visual representation of Steve Reich’s Piano Phase using planet orbits](https://codepen.io/collection/Xermmq)
- [a beat creation system where each portion of the beat is represented by a component of a hamburger](https://codepen.io/sparlos/pen/argZay)

Every project was implemented using Vue for logic and SCSS for styling. The source code for all of the projects is available for perusal at the CodePen links provided.

A [website](https://livestreamradio.netlify.com/) that allows a user to add and categorize YouTube livestreams as “stations”. Open source and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/sparlos/livestream-radio).

The project was written using Vue and Vuetify, a material design framework for Vue. This website allows the user to categorize and easily switch between different YouTube livestreams. This site showcases my ability to take an idea and follow through to full implementation. The project is also completely open source, and has a few contributors whose efforts I manage.

Time restrictions, which compelled me to complete the build within a week, wound up being extremely beneficial for the project, forcing the most crucial features to the forefront.

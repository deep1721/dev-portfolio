A [website](https://livestreamradio.netlify.com/) that allows a user to add & categorize YouTube livestreams as “stations”. Open source and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/sparlos/livestream-radio).

The project was written using Vue and Vuetify, a material design framework for Vue. This website started from a personal need to be able to categorize and easily switch between different YouTube livestreams. It shows my ability to take an idea and follow through with a desired implementation. The project is also completely open source, and has a few contributors whose efforts I manage.

Time restrictions meant this site had to be built within a week. This restriction ended up being extremely beneficial for the project, forcing the most crucial features to the forefront.

A [website](http://bdgconnect.com/) created for the Baseball Development Group organization. I was given a design and created a WordPress theme based on it from scratch. Almost everything on the site is customizable/editable by the owner/operator, with a particular highlight being a variable amount of team member’s on the “about us” page.

This was my first endeavour into WordPress and learned many valuable lessons about creating custom themes, from WP-specific syntax to integrating plugins into my theme. For design, I used Bootstrap for the mobile responsivity and hand-coded custom animations for things like the button hover and the navbar expansion on mobile.

[A recreation of the twitch.tv homepage layout](https://codepen.io/sparlos/full/JxyRWr) from February 2019; the layout has since been changed. This project really shows off my ability to take a completely visual design and implement it in code. All of the CSS (SCSS) was hand-coded and no framework was used. Most of the page was created using flexbox, and all of the SCSS follows the BEM methodology.

This project was mostly focused on design, so there isn’t much actual functionality. The only exception is the video carousel, which was implemented using Vue. The design is semi-responsive, but doesn’t scale fully down to mobile. This is because at the time the actual twitch.tv main page did not either. You can find the source code [here](https://codepen.io/sparlos/pen/JxyRWr).
